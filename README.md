# Objectives
The objective of this program is to understand how stress and strain develop around a tunnel. This will be be based on a finite-difference MATLAB code using viscosity, velocity and pressure to compute the stress and strain in a two-dimension matrix. The goal is then to explore many variables and understand wich one of them as an influence.

# About this repository
In this repository you can find:
- the Matlab code base [TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.m](TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.m)
- a file with all the codes used to produce the different figures [TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel/Figures_Matlab/](TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel/Figures_Matlab/)


# Bachelor thesis
The matlab code is presented in the Bachelor thesis, as are all the figure, results and equations used. Please refer to : [TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.pdf](TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.pdf)

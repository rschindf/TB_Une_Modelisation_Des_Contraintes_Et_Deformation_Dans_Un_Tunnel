# Objectives
The objective of this Bachelor thesis is to understand how stress and strain develop around a tunnel. This will be be based on a finite-difference MATLAB code using viscosity, velocity and pressure to compute the stress and strain in a two-dimension matrix. The goal is then to explore many variables and understand wich one of them as an influence, and how it develops around the tunnel.

# About this repository
In this repository you can find:
- the main Matlab code : [TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.m](TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel.m)
- a file with all the codes used to produce the different figures : [Figures_Matlab](Figures_Matlab/). These codes are named and numbered after their use in the Bachelor thesis. 


# Bachelor thesis
The matlab code is presented in the Bachelor thesis, as are all the figure, results and equations used. Please refer to : [TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel_Schindfessel.pdf](TB_Une_Modelisation_Des_Contraintes_Et_Deformation_Dans_Un_Tunnel_Schindfessel.pdf)
